# Playwright DemoBlaze Automation

## 📘 Overview

This project is an end-to-end test automation framework built using Microsoft Playwright.
It validates the core functionalities of the Demoblaze web application, including:

*   🛍️ Product browsing

*   🧺 Adding items to the cart

*   🔐 User signup & login

*   💳 Order placement

## ⚙️ Key Features

✅ Page Object Model (POM) – modular and maintainable design  
✅ Detailed test steps and assertions using test.step()  
✅ Automatic screenshots on failure  
✅ Custom utility functions for data parsing, waits, and logging.  
✅ Cross-browser and parallel test execution.  
✅ Configurable test data via JSON or environment variables.  
🚧 CI/CD-ready with GitHub Actions workflow.
